# powertac-core

Core modules needed for both broker and server:

- [metadata](metadata/README.md)
- [aop](aop/README.md)
- [common](common/README.md)
- [broker-core](broker-core/README.md)

Travis CI automatically builds upon new commits. The JavaDocs, however, are compiled as integrated into the powertac-server
build; please refer to the README of powertac-server for more details:
